# 🏭 Industrial Sorting System – PLC Simulation

🎓 **Graduation Project**  
IEEE Control & PLC Workshop (2024–2025) – Cairo University Student Branch

This project simulates an industrial **box sorting system** using Siemens PLCs, TIA Portal, and Factory I/O. It was developed as the graduation project of the IEEE CUSB Control & PLC Workshop.

The system detects the height of boxes using proximity sensors, classifies them into three levels, and activates actuators to direct each box to the correct conveyor belt — just like a real factory line!

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This project was developed as part of the **IEEE Control & PLC Workshop** at Cairo University.  
Special thanks to all the instructors who were always available — not only during the sessions, but also when I needed help with other projects.  
💙 **Special appreciation to our amazing workshop head** for the constant support, availability, and inspiring guidance!

## 🚀 Future Applications

This sorting system reflects real-world applications used in packaging lines, warehouses, and industrial manufacturing. It helped me gain hands-on experience with PLCs, industrial sensors, and factory automation tools — skills I look forward to applying in future projects.
